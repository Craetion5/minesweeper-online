# System goals

The purpose is to provide a minesweeper game that can be played collaboratively online via an internet connection. The game should have all the staple minesweeper features, such as appropriate game logic, flags and game customization.

One important goal is that everything in the game state syncs properly between clients. Clicks in the game grid should be registered and update the game state accordingly. Likewise, starting a new game should apply properly for all clients.
